## ⚠️ BROWSER CACHE ISSUE

The 500 errors you're seeing in the browser console are **cached responses** from previous failed attempts.

### Fix - Clear Browser Cache:

**Method 1: Hard Refresh**
```
Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
```

**Method 2: Incognito/Private Window**
```
Open a new incognito window
Navigate to: https://aegis-neo.vercel.app
```

**Method 3: Clear Cache Manually**
```
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
```

## 🧪 Verification Tests

### Backend Tests (All Passing):
```powershell
# Health check
Invoke-RestMethod "https://aegis-production-1445.up.railway.app/health"
# Result: {"status":"healthy","nasa_api_configured":true}

# Asteroids list
Invoke-RestMethod "https://aegis-production-1445.up.railway.app/api/asteroids/list?limit=5"
# Result: 15 asteroids returned

# Trajectory for Apophis
Invoke-RestMethod "https://aegis-production-1445.up.railway.app/api/trajectory/Apophis"
# Result: 365 trajectory points returned successfully
```

### CORS Verification:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://aegis-neo.vercel.app  ✅
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true  ✅
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, PUT  ✅
```

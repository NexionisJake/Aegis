## ⚠️ FINAL STEP REQUIRED

### Backend Not Starting - Here's Why & How to Fix:

**Problem**: Railway shows "Application failed to respond" (502)  
**Cause**: Railway settings need adjustment  
**Fix Time**: ~5-10 minutes

### 🔧 What You Need to Do RIGHT NOW:

#### 1. Open Railway Settings
- Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
- Click your project: **Aegis**
- Click **Settings** tab

#### 2. Verify These Settings:

**Source > Root Directory**:
```
backend
```
(Make sure it's exactly `backend` - no slashes, no quotes)

**Deploy > Start Command**:
```
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```
(Copy this EXACTLY - use `$PORT` not `${PORT}`)

#### 3. Redeploy
- Go to **Deployments** tab
- Click "..." on latest deployment
- Click "Redeploy"
- Wait 2-3 minutes

#### 4. Check Logs
- Click on the deployment
- Click "View Logs"
- Look for: **"Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000"**
- If you see errors, check `RAILWAY-QUICK-FIX.md`

#### 5. Test
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\abhi2\OneDrive\Desktop\satwik nasa\Aegis-frontend_change"
.\test-deployment.ps1
```

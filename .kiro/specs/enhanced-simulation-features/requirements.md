# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the asteroid impact simulation application with three critical improvements: dynamic impact parameters that use real asteroid data instead of hardcoded values, user-selectable impact locations through interactive 3D Earth clicking, and scientifically accurate Earth orbit synchronization. These enhancements transform the application from a static demonstration into an interactive, scientifically accurate simulation tool that provides personalized "what-if" scenarios for asteroid impacts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Impact Parameters

**User Story:** As a user studying asteroid impacts, I want the simulation to use the actual physical parameters of the selected asteroid, so that the impact calculations are scientifically accurate and specific to the asteroid I'm viewing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an asteroid THEN the system SHALL fetch and store the complete asteroid dataset including diameter and velocity
2. WHEN a user initiates an impact simulation THEN the system SHALL use the stored asteroid's actual diameter and velocity parameters instead of hardcoded values
3. WHEN asteroid data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and prevent simulation execution
4. WHEN the impact calculation is performed THEN the system SHALL extract diameter from the asteroid's physical parameters and velocity from close approach data
5. IF the asteroid data structure changes THEN the system SHALL handle parsing errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback

### Requirement 2: User-Selectable Impact Location

**User Story:** As a user exploring impact scenarios, I want to click anywhere on the 3D Earth model to set the impact location, so that I can simulate impacts in different geographic regions and understand localized effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the 3D Earth model THEN the system SHALL detect the click coordinates and convert them to geographic latitude/longitude
2. WHEN a valid Earth surface point is clicked THEN the system SHALL update the impact location state with the new coordinates
3. WHEN the impact simulation is run THEN the system SHALL use the user-selected coordinates for the 2D map visualization
4. WHEN a user clicks outside the Earth mesh THEN the system SHALL ignore the click and maintain the current impact location
5. WHEN the impact location is changed THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to confirm the new location selection
6. IF no impact location has been selected THEN the system SHALL use a default location (India coordinates: 20.5937, 78.9629)

### Requirement 3: Accurate Earth Orbit Synchronization

**User Story:** As a researcher using the simulation for scientific analysis, I want Earth's orbital trajectory to be calculated using the same time intervals and epoch as the asteroid, so that the orbital mechanics are scientifically consistent and synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating trajectories THEN the system SHALL use the asteroid's epoch time as the reference point for both Earth and asteroid calculations
2. WHEN generating time intervals THEN the system SHALL create a shared time array that both Earth and asteroid trajectory calculations use
3. WHEN calculating Earth's position THEN the system SHALL use poliastro's built-in ephemeris data instead of simplified orbital approximations
4. WHEN trajectory calculation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating whether the failure was in asteroid or Earth calculations
5. WHEN both trajectories are calculated THEN the system SHALL ensure they cover the same time period with identical time steps
6. IF the epoch time is invalid THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the user

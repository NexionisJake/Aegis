# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Project Aegis is a web application that enables users to visualize the orbital path of near-Earth asteroids in 3D space and simulate the consequences of their potential impact on Earth. The application provides an educational and scientific tool for understanding asteroid trajectories and impact scenarios through interactive 3D visualization and 2D impact mapping.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to automatically see a predefined asteroid's orbital path when I load the application, so that I can immediately understand its trajectory relative to Earth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch orbital data for Apophis asteroid from NASA APIs
2. WHEN the data is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL display a 3D scene showing the Sun, Earth, and asteroid orbital paths
3. WHEN the 3D scene renders THEN the system SHALL show Earth's orbit as a distinct colored line
4. WHEN the 3D scene renders THEN the system SHALL show the asteroid's orbital path as a different colored line
5. WHEN the orbital paths are displayed THEN the system SHALL position Earth at its current location on its orbit
6. WHEN the scene is interactive THEN the system SHALL allow users to rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D view

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see accurate orbital mechanics calculations, so that I can trust the scientific validity of the visualization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching asteroid data THEN the system SHALL retrieve orbital elements including semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, longitude of ascending node, argument of periapsis, and mean anomaly
2. WHEN calculating trajectories THEN the system SHALL use the poliastro library for high-precision orbital mechanics
3. WHEN generating orbital paths THEN the system SHALL calculate approximately 365 coordinate points for smooth trajectory visualization
4. WHEN displaying orbits THEN the system SHALL use the Sun as the gravitational attractor for all calculations
5. WHEN propagating orbits THEN the system SHALL calculate positions over a 2-year time span for comprehensive visualization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to simulate an asteroid impact, so that I can understand the potential consequences of a collision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the 3D orbital visualization THEN the system SHALL display a "Simulate Impact" button
2. WHEN the user clicks "Simulate Impact" THEN the system SHALL switch from 3D view to 2D map view
3. WHEN calculating impact effects THEN the system SHALL use the asteroid's diameter and velocity to compute crater size and impact energy
4. WHEN performing impact calculations THEN the system SHALL assume a standard asteroid density of 3000 kg/mÂ³
5. WHEN computing crater diameter THEN the system SHALL use kinetic energy and established crater formation formulas
6. WHEN displaying impact results THEN the system SHALL show a circle on the map representing the calculated crater size
7. WHEN showing impact location THEN the system SHALL use a predefined impact coordinate for the MVP

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see impact consequences displayed clearly, so that I can understand the scale of potential damage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the impact simulation completes THEN the system SHALL display an information box with impact statistics
2. WHEN showing impact data THEN the system SHALL include crater diameter in meters
3. WHEN showing impact data THEN the system SHALL include total impact energy in joules
4. WHEN displaying the crater on the map THEN the system SHALL center the map view on the impact location
5. WHEN showing the crater circle THEN the system SHALL scale it accurately relative to the map's coordinate system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to use a specific technology stack, so that it meets the project's technical requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the backend THEN the system SHALL use Python 3.10+ with FastAPI framework
2. WHEN building the frontend THEN the system SHALL use React 18+ with Vite for project setup
3. WHEN implementing 3D visualization THEN the system SHALL use Three.js with @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei
4. WHEN implementing 2D mapping THEN the system SHALL use Leaflet with react-leaflet
5. WHEN making API calls THEN the backend SHALL use the requests library and frontend SHALL use axios
6. WHEN performing orbital calculations THEN the system SHALL use the poliastro library
7. WHEN managing environment variables THEN the system SHALL use python-dotenv

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle data fetching reliably, so that I can consistently access asteroid information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load the NASA API key from environment variables
2. WHEN fetching asteroid data THEN the system SHALL make requests to the NASA JPL Small-Body Database API
3. WHEN requesting orbital data THEN the system SHALL include orbital parameters (orb=1) and physical parameters (phys-par=1)
4. WHEN the backend serves data THEN the system SHALL include CORS middleware to allow frontend requests
5. IF the NASA API request fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and user feedback

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth transitions between views, so that I can easily navigate between orbital visualization and impact simulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching from 3D to 2D view THEN the system SHALL maintain application state and data
2. WHEN the view changes THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback about the current mode
3. WHEN in 2D map view THEN the system SHALL allow users to return to 3D orbital view
4. WHEN loading either view THEN the system SHALL provide loading indicators during data processing
5. WHEN views are rendered THEN the system SHALL ensure responsive design across different screen sizes

### Frontend
- [ ] API base URL configured for production
- [ ] Error boundaries implemented
- [ ] Loading states handled
- [ ] Offline support considered
- [ ] Browser compatibility tested
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` configured
- [ ] `.dockerignore` files in place
- [ ] Environment variables in `.env` file
- [ ] Docker images build successfully
- [ ] Containers start without errors
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Volumes configured for data persistence (if needed)

### Cloud Platform Deployment
- [ ] Platform selected (Vercel, Railway, Render, Heroku, AWS, GCP)
- [ ] Account created and billing configured
- [ ] Deployment configuration files created
- [ ] Environment variables configured in platform
- [ ] Custom domain configured (if applicable)
- [ ] SSL certificate configured
- [ ] Auto-deployment configured (if desired)

## Post-Deployment

### Verification
- [ ] Application accessible at production URL
- [ ] API endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] Frontend-backend communication working
- [ ] NASA API integration working
- [ ] 3D visualizations rendering correctly
- [ ] All features functional
- [ ] Mobile version working
- [ ] Different browsers tested

### Monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking configured (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Application monitoring set up (New Relic, DataDog, etc.)
- [ ] Uptime monitoring configured (UptimeRobot, etc.)
- [ ] Log aggregation configured
- [ ] Alerts configured for critical errors
- [ ] Performance monitoring enabled

### Documentation
- [ ] Deployment process documented
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] User guide updated
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide created
- [ ] Team trained on deployment process

### Backup & Recovery
- [ ] Backup strategy defined
- [ ] Database backups configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Environment variables backed up securely
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan created

### Performance
- [ ] Load testing performed
- [ ] Performance baseline established
- [ ] CDN configured (if needed)
- [ ] Caching headers configured
- [ ] Compression enabled (gzip/brotli)

### Legal & Compliance
- [ ] Privacy policy updated
- [ ] Terms of service updated
- [ ] NASA API terms of use reviewed
- [ ] Data protection compliance verified
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG)

## Ongoing Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Monitor error rates daily
- [ ] Review performance metrics weekly
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Security audit quarterly
- [ ] Backup verification quarterly
- [ ] Load testing quarterly

### Update Process
- [ ] Staging environment available
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured
- [ ] Automated tests in pipeline
- [ ] Deployment schedule defined
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Issues
- **CORS errors**: Check `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in backend `.env`
- **API connection failed**: Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in frontend
- **NASA API errors**: Check API key and rate limits
- **Build fails**: Clear cache and reinstall dependencies
- **Container won't start**: Check logs with `docker-compose logs`

# ⚡ URGENT: Railway Backend Configuration Steps

## 🚨 Current Issue
**Error**: "Application failed to respond" (502 Bad Gateway)  
**Meaning**: Railway deployed the code, but the Python app isn't starting

---

## ✅ What I've Done for You

1. ✅ Created `railway.toml` configuration file
2. ✅ All environment variables are set
3. ✅ Frontend is deployed and working
4. ⏳ Backend needs Railway settings adjustment

---

## 🔧 CRITICAL: Fix Railway Settings (DO THIS NOW)

### In Railway Dashboard - Settings Tab:

You need to check/update these specific settings:

#### 1. **Source Settings**
```
Root Directory: backend
```
**Important**: Make sure it's exactly `backend` (no slashes, no extra spaces)

#### 2. **Build Settings**
```
Builder: Nixpacks (should be auto-detected)
Build Command: (leave empty - will use railway.toml)
```

#### 3. **Deploy Settings** (MOST IMPORTANT)
```
Start Command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

**Make sure**:
- It's exactly this command
- Uses `$PORT` not `${PORT}` or hardcoded 8000
- No extra quotes around the command
- Space between `0.0.0.0` and `--port`

#### 4. **Service Settings**
```
Region: Any (US West recommended for speed)
Auto-Sleep: Disabled (if you want 24/7 availability)
```

## 📤 Push Railway Configuration

I've created `railway.toml` - now push it to GitHub:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\abhi2\OneDrive\Desktop\satwik nasa\Aegis-frontend_change"
git add backend/railway.toml backend/vercel.json
git commit -m "Add Railway configuration"
git push origin main
```

Then in Railway:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Source**
2. Click **Redeploy** or **Trigger Deploy**
3. Wait 2-3 minutes

---

## 🔍 Check Deployment Logs (CRUCIAL)

**This is the most important step!** The logs will tell you exactly what's wrong.

### How to View Logs:

1. Railway Dashboard → Your Project
2. Click **Deployments** (left sidebar)
3. Click on the **latest deployment**
4. Click **View Logs** button
5. **Look for these specific messages:**

### ✅ Good Messages (You WANT to see these):
```
Successfully installed fastapi-0.117.1 uvicorn-0.37.0 ...
Starting Uvicorn...
Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
Application startup complete
```

### ❌ Bad Messages (These indicate problems):
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xxx'
→ Missing dependency - check requirements.txt

ImportError: cannot import name 'xxx'  
→ Code issue or wrong Python version

Error: Cannot find module 'main'
→ Root directory is wrong (should be 'backend')

Address already in use
→ Port configuration issue

command not found: uvicorn
→ Start command is wrong
```

---

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Fix Process

### Step 1: Check Settings (5 minutes)
1. Railway → Settings tab
2. Verify Root Directory = `backend`
3. Verify Start Command = `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
4. Save if you changed anything

### Step 2: Push railway.toml (2 minutes)
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\abhi2\OneDrive\Desktop\satwik nasa\Aegis-frontend_change"
git add backend/railway.toml backend/vercel.json
git commit -m "Add Railway configuration"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Redeploy (3 minutes wait)
1. Railway → Deployments
2. Click "..." menu on latest deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"
4. Watch the logs

### Step 4: Check Logs (1 minute)
Look for "Uvicorn running on..." message

### Step 5: Test (30 seconds)
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\abhi2\OneDrive\Desktop\satwik nasa\Aegis-frontend_change"
.\test-deployment.ps1
```

## 🐛 Common Railway Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: "Cannot find module 'main'"
**Fix**: 
- Settings → Root Directory → Change to `backend`
- Redeploy

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError"
**Fix**:
- Check `backend/requirements.txt` has all packages
- Specifically check for: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `poliastro`
- Redeploy

### Issue: "command not found: uvicorn"
**Fix**:
- Start Command should be: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- Make sure there's NO extra characters
- Redeploy

### Issue: "Port already in use"
**Fix**:
- Change start command to use `$PORT` (Railway's variable)
- NOT hardcoded 8000
- Redeploy

### Issue: Still 502 after all fixes
**Possible causes**:
1. Railway free trial expired (check billing)
2. Account needs verification
3. Service is paused/sleeping
4. Region issue (try different region)

## 📞 What to Share If Still Not Working

If after all this it's still not working, share:

1. **Screenshot of Railway Settings** (Source section showing Root Directory)
2. **Screenshot of Deployment Logs** (last 50 lines)
3. **Error message** from the logs
4. **Service status** (is it active/paused/crashed?)

---

## 🎯 Expected Timeline

- Configuration changes: **5 minutes**
- Push to GitHub: **2 minutes**
- Railway redeploy: **3-5 minutes**
- Testing: **1 minute**

**Total**: ~15 minutes to get backend working

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

1. ✅ Railway logs show "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:xxxx"
2. ✅ Health check returns: `{"status":"healthy","nasa_api_configured":true}`
3. ✅ Test script shows all SUCCESS messages
4. ✅ Frontend can load asteroid data

---

## 🚀 After Backend Works

Once backend is up:

1. Visit https://aegis-neo.vercel.app
2. Wait for asteroids to load
3. Click any asteroid
4. Verify 3D visualization works
5. Test impact calculator
6. Celebrate! 🎉

---

**Next Action**: 
1. Check Railway Settings → Root Directory (must be `backend`)
2. Check Start Command (must be exact: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`)
3. View deployment logs
4. Share what you see!

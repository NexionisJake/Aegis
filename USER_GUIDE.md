## üéÆ How to Use Aegis

### Getting Started

1. **Launch the Application**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the Aegis application
   - The system will automatically load real data for asteroid Apophis from NASA

2. **Choose Your View**
   - **3D View**: Interactive solar system with Earth and asteroid orbits
   - **2D View**: Detailed impact map showing effects and damage zones

---

## üåç Step-by-Step: Selecting Your Impact Location

### Method 1: Click on 3D Earth (Recommended)

1. **Switch to 3D View** (if not already there)
2. **Find the Blue Earth** in the solar system model
3. **Click anywhere on Earth's surface**
   - Click on continents, oceans, or any location you're curious about
   - You'll see a brief green glow confirming your selection
4. **Your coordinates are now set!** The system remembers your choice

### Method 2: Use Default Location
- If you don't click anywhere, Aegis uses India as the default impact location
- You can change this anytime by clicking on the 3D Earth model

## üí• Running Impact Simulations

### Calculate the Impact
1. **Select "Simulate Impact"** button
2. **Watch the magic happen:**
   - Aegis extracts real size and speed data for Apophis from NASA
   - Calculates impact effects using scientific formulas
   - Shows results at your selected location

### Understanding Your Results
The simulation will show you:
- **Crater Size**: How big the impact crater would be
- **Blast Radius**: Area of immediate destruction
- **Thermal Effects**: Heat damage zone
- **Impact Energy**: Total energy released (in megatons)

## üöÄ Exploring the 3D Solar System

### What You'll See
- **Red Trail**: Apophis asteroid's orbital path
- **Blue Trail**: Earth's orbital path  
- **Yellow Dot**: The Sun
- **Blue Sphere**: Earth (clickable for impact location)

### Cool Features
- **Realistic Orbits**: Both Earth and the asteroid follow scientifically accurate paths
- **Time Synchronized**: Shows where both objects are at the same time
- **2-Year Timeline**: See orbital positions over 2 years from now

### Navigation Tips
- **Mouse/Touch**: Rotate and zoom the 3D view
- **Scroll**: Zoom in and out
- **Drag**: Rotate the camera around the solar system

## üó∫Ô∏è Understanding the Impact Map

### When You Switch to 2D View:
- **Red Circle**: Direct blast damage zone
- **Orange Ring**: Thermal radiation effects
- **Map Center**: Your selected impact location
- **Geographic Details**: Real terrain and landmarks

### Reading the Data
- **Crater Diameter**: Size of the hole created by impact
- **Energy Released**: Comparison to nuclear weapons (megatons)
- **Affected Area**: How far the damage extends
- **Population Impact**: Areas that would be affected

## üéØ Pro Tips for Best Experience

### Getting Accurate Results
- **Click precisely** on the 3D Earth where you want to test
- **Try different locations**: Cities, oceans, mountains - see how terrain affects impact
- **Compare results**: Test multiple locations to see differences

### Cool Things to Try
1. **Test Your City**: Click on your hometown and see the effects
2. **Ocean Impact**: Click on oceans to see tsunami effects
3. **Mountain Ranges**: See how terrain changes impact calculations
4. **Different Continents**: Compare effects across the globe

### Understanding the Science
- **Real NASA Data**: All asteroid information comes from NASA's database
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Impact calculations use peer-reviewed formulas
- **Orbital Mechanics**: Trajectories calculated with professional astronomy software

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If Something Doesn't Work:

**Problem: Can't select location on Earth**
- Make sure you're in 3D view
- Click directly on the blue Earth sphere
- Try zooming in closer to Earth

**Problem: No impact results**
- Check that you clicked "Simulate Impact" button
- Ensure the app finished loading NASA data
- Try refreshing the page if needed

**Problem: 3D view not loading**
- Make sure your browser supports WebGL
- Try a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Check that JavaScript is enabled
